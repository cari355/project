        <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>I'm a 27 year old first time mom trying to better my life by taking this course so in turn I can provide for my family. Regarding this website, I created this page with the help of the awesome community and leadership Correlation One provides, and will keep on adding to it as visual proof of what I've learned.</p>
          <p>My interest in coding started in my second year of high school, when I joined the social media site Tumblr. On Tumblr, you have your own blog and you're free to customize it any way you want, including the option of diving into your blog's code yourself. Because of that, I looked up free online code training sites to learn more and I stumbled upon Codecademy. They offer free classes in multiple programming languages. Their lessons definitely strengthened my HTML and CSS skills, making my transition into this class that much smoother.</p>
